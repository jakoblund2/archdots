Use bluetoothctl or blueman. bluetoothctl is needed for keyboard pairing and blueman is an easy gui

Remember to install solaar and enable Scroll Wheel Resolution for the bluetooth mode on the mouse. Otherwise scrolling will be very slow

Add mouse in blueman by settings mouse in pairing mode by hold down profile button. Search for new devices in blueman and add the mouse as trusted and create pairing.

Before reading the below, try to just connect keyboard in the same gui as mouse, it works sometimes. Remember that using the gui is connected to the below terminal i.e. clicking buttons with mouse is the same as commands. Handy when you cant use the keyboard because it is in pairing mode.

The keyboard must have a pairing passkey which isnt shown in blueman, which is why bluetoothctl is needed. Put keyboard in pairing mode by holding down a profile buttion. In a terminal

bluetoothctl
power on
agent KeyboardDisplay
default-agent
scan on

Passkey should pop up in terminal. Enter it on keyboard and press enter
