To use gamescope insert this into Steam game launch options DRI_PRIME=1 gamescope --backend sdl --force-grab-cursor -f -w 1920 -h 1080 -W 2560 -H 1440 -F fsr -r 60 -- %command%

DRI_PRIME=1 use main graphics card instead of iGPU
gamescope name of program
--backend sdl use sdl - default does not work
--force-grab-cursor otherwise cursor escapes game
-f fullscreen
-w 1920 -h 1080 make game think this is a 1080p screen
-W 2560 -H 1440 upscale to 1440p
-F fsr use FSR
-r 60 cap framerate at 60
-- %command% must be used for it to work

To get games supporting FSR working, use Goverlay. Remember that this only works for games that explicitly support this!
